Testing Your Ruby Code - Enumerable

Project for Microverse, running RSpec on previous project, which was the creation of custom methods that should work as some Ruby standard methods, those are:

'#each, #select, #all, #none, #any, #count and #map'

On console, go to project root folder and run rspec command, all tests should pass without any errors.
